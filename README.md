This repository contains my solutions to various **Codewars** challenges in the **Go** programming language. By solving these tasks, I am improving my proficiency in Go, practicing problem-solving techniques, and reinforcing my understanding of Go concepts like goroutines, channels, data structures, and algorithms.

## 📖 About

On **Codewars**, I am tackling challenges (Kata) of varying difficulty levels. From basic syntax to more advanced topics like concurrency and memory management, this repository serves as a track record of my Go learning journey. I aim to continuously update this repo with new solutions as I progress.

## 🚀 Goals

- **Improve Go skills**: Enhance my knowledge of Go's core language features, idiomatic programming patterns, and best practices.
- **Practice algorithms**: Strengthen my problem-solving ability by implementing a variety of algorithms.
- **Refine my understanding**: Explore Go features like goroutines, channels, and concurrency patterns.

## 💻 Structure of the Repository

Each challenge has its own folder containing:

- **`problem.md`**: A description of the challenge.
- **`solution.go`**: My solution implemented in Go.
- **`test.go`** (optional): Unit tests for verifying the solution.
